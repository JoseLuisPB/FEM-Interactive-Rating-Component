## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript
- SCSS /SASS as CSS preprocesor

### Continued development

On future projects I want to focus in animations because it is something I do not practice very often and gives the component a more profesional look.
